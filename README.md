## Overview

This is a Verilog-based implementation of an **"Only Up"-style 2D pixel art game**.  
The project features a vertical-scrolling gameplay mechanic, where the player controls a character navigating upward through obstacles.  
The design is targeted for FPGA deployment with VGA display output.

## Repository Structure

project-root/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ main/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Contains the core logic of the project. All Verilog source files (.v) and constraint files (.xdc) are located here.
â”‚ This includes the top-level module, FSM, VGA controller, collision detection, and game logic.
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ vga_test/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Used during development to test individual components or features in isolation.
â”‚ Includes simple testbenches and test modules for debugging VGA output and other subsystems.
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ image_gen/
â””â”€â”€ Contains Verilog modules for RAM initialization to store pixel data for sprites. This includes:
- Character sprites in different animation states
- Obstacle graphics and other game elements
Each module here defines the memory structure used to render pixel-based graphics in the game
